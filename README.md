# Traffic Counts API

API for DVRPC's traffic counts database, which is hosted on Oracle's cloud server and configured to allow connections from whitelisted IP addresses only. 

The following configuration variables should go in a git-ignored config.py file at the root level:
  * USER (database user)
  * PASSWORD (database password)
  * DB (database)
  * URL_ROOT (path preceding individual endpoints)

An example is provided at config.py.example.

See full documentation of the API at <https://cloud.dvrpc.org/api/traffic-counts/v1/docs> and <https://cloud.dvrpc.org/api/traffic-counts/v2/docs>.

## Development

A server on Digital Ocean (oracle-dev) has been whitelisted for development purposes. Use the requirements_dev.txt file to create a Python virtual environment, and then run `fastapi dev` from the activated virtual environment to start a development server. Use ssh tunneling to reach endpoints locally (e.g. `ssh -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8000 [host]` to access <http://localhost:8000/api/traffic-counts/v2/docs> in your browser).

## Production

Managed by [cloud-ansible project](https://github.com/dvrpc/cloud-ansible).
